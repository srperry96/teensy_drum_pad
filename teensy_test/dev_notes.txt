This requires various extra libraries to run. Took a while to figure it out when setting up the project on another laptop.
- ILI9341_t3
- Adafruit Seesaw
- Teensy Audio
- Adafruit NeoMatrix
- SPI
- Possibly some others I've forgotten


Max 3 concurrent wav files as 4 starts glitching out

ok bit rate seems to be 1411
clap1 at 705 works (1411 / 2 i guess, so it accepts it?)
some of the 705 samples not working - all 1411 so far ok i think

From teensy documentation (in the design tool, wavplayer module):
    Only 16 bit PCM, 44100 Hz WAV files are supported

TODO
    Add look up table for all the notes, rather than the maths way atm - save compute, more accurate etc

    Add step sequencer functionality
    Add some fancy(ish) graphics for the wave generator

    Could probably do a 2 channel looper - adding LineIn guitar jack inputs too

    Move the TrellisCallbacks into NeotrellisBits instead of Menu as it is getting quite bloated

Started on the looper bits. 
    Got a file recording and playing back using the microphone.
    Mic noise caused by writing to SD card
        Apparently this is fixed if you use a teensy 3.6 inbuilt SD card, so this could be a future development
    Need to clean up the code for it a bit and add in overdubbing
        Recording to 2 files, swapping back and forth each time between playing and recording.




BROKE THE LOOPER STUFF - NOT SURE YOU CAN READ AND WRITE TO THE SD CARD AT THE SAME TIME.
    SOUND WAS FREAKING OUT -- INVESTIGATE FURTHER
